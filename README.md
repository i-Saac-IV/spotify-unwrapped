# Spotify Unwrapped
Just gives a nice way to look at your spotify stats over the time you've had your account.

## Features
- It's got some filtering, check this line to change it...
```
MIN_PLAYTIME_S = 30
```
- You can change the range of the graphs...
```
TOP_N = 50
```
## To do
- [x] Probably not a lot, this is just a side project...

# Usage
## Setup
- Download your extented listening history from spotfiy and extract the .json files to be in the same directory as the [main.py](main.py) file.
- Run the [main.py](main.py) file input the dates that you'd like to display data to and from.

## Example Graphs

## Bugs fixes and updates
Once I'm happy with the state of this project, it will likely not be updated much. So updates past this point will be very sporadic.
